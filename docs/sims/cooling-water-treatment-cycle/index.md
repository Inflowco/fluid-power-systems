[Run the Cooling Water Treatment Cycle MicroSim](main.html){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

## About this MicroSim

This interactive flow diagram shows cooling water moving through the complete treatment cycle — from the cooling tower through chemical injection points, circulating pumps, filters, and heat exchangers — with water quality indicators at each stage and animated chemical treatment pulses.

## Learning Objective

Students will be able to describe the purpose of each chemical treatment in a cooling water system and trace the treatment cycle from makeup water through the recirculating loop.
