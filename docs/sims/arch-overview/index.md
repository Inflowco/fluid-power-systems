## About This MicroSim

This interactive diagram shows how the six components of the intelligent textbook system work together:

1. **You (the Author)** - Write content and guide the AI assistant
2. **VS Code (Your Desk)** - The workspace where you see and edit files
3. **Claude Code (AI Helper)** - AI assistant that reads, writes, and organizes files
4. **MkDocs (Book Maker)** - Converts Markdown files into a beautiful website
5. **GitHub (Cloud Locker)** - Stores the project and hosts the website
6. **Readers (The World)** - Anyone can access the published textbook

## The Everyday Workflow

1. Open VS Code or talk to Claude Code in the terminal
2. Edit Markdown files together - chapters, sims, config
3. MkDocs bakes those files into a pretty website
4. Git pushes everything to GitHub for safekeeping
5. GitHub Pages serves the website to the world

## How to Use

- **Hover** over a component to see its description
- **Click** a component to highlight its connections
- **Follow the arrows** to understand the data flow

## Lesson Plan

**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to explain how the components of an intelligent textbook system work together to create and publish educational content.

**Activities:**

1. Explore the diagram by hovering over each component
2. Trace the flow from Author to Readers
3. Identify which components handle content creation vs. publishing
4. Discuss: What would happen if one component was removed?

**Assessment:** Ask students to describe the role of each component and how data flows between them.
