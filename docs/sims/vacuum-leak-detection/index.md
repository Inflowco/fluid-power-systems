## About this MicroSim

This interactive simulation lets students practice finding leaks in a vacuum system. Students evacuate the system, isolate the pump, observe the pressure decay curve, then use detection tools (spray bottle, helium probe, ultrasonic detector) to locate the hidden leak among six potential leak points.

## Learning Objective

Students will be able to perform a systematic leak detection procedure on a vacuum system by observing pressure decay curves and locating leak sources.
