## About this MicroSim

This animated diagram shows cross-section views of four cooling tower configurations — natural draft, induced draft counterflow, forced draft crossflow, and induced draft crossflow — with animated air and water flow paths to illustrate their operating principles. Summary cards below each tower display key specifications.

## Learning Objective

Students will be able to compare the operating principles of different cooling tower types and classify each by its airflow pattern and draft method.
