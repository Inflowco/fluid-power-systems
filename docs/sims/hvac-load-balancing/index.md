[Run the HVAC Load Balancing MicroSim](main.html){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

## About this MicroSim

This simulation demonstrates how AI load balancing distributes cooling workload across multiple air handling units. Toggle between unbalanced and AI-balanced modes while adjusting time of day and outdoor temperature to see the energy impact.

## Learning Objective

Students will be able to demonstrate how AI load balancing distributes HVAC workload across multiple units and predict the energy impact of balanced versus unbalanced operation.
