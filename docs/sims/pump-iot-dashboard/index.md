## About this MicroSim

This simulated IoT monitoring dashboard displays real-time pump sensor data across six critical parameters: vibration, motor temperature, suction pressure, discharge pressure, flow rate, and power consumption. Select from six fault scenarios (Normal Operation, Bearing Failure, Cavitation, Shaft Misalignment, Clogged Strainer, Worn Impeller) and advance time to observe how parameters degrade. Click any gauge to view its 24-hour trend history. AI-generated recommendations update based on current conditions.

## Learning Objective

Students will be able to analyze real-time pump monitoring data to distinguish between normal operation and developing fault conditions using IoT sensor readings and trend analysis.
