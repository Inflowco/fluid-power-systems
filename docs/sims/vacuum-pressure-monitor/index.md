## About this MicroSim

This simulated vacuum system monitoring dashboard displays real-time sensor data for a vacuum system including pressure, motor current, temperature, vibration, and oil condition. Students can switch between fault scenarios to practice diagnosing problems from pressure trends and correlated sensor patterns.

## Learning Objective

Students will be able to interpret vacuum system pressure data from a monitoring dashboard and diagnose common fault conditions based on pressure trends and sensor patterns.
