## About this MicroSim

This interactive system schematic shows a complete industrial vacuum system with labeled components — pump, check valve, receiver tank, gauges, isolation valve, header, and process points. A pressure gradient visualization shows how vacuum level changes from pump to process point, and animated gas molecules flow through the piping.

## Learning Objective

Students will be able to describe the major components of an industrial vacuum system and identify the function of each component in the system schematic.
