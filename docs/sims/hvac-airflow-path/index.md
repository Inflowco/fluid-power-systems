## About this MicroSim

This animated diagram shows the complete path of air through a typical HVAC air handling unit, from return air through filtration, heating/cooling coils, and supply fan to the occupied space. Particles change color at each stage to show how air is conditioned.

## Learning Objective

Students will be able to trace the path of air through a typical HVAC system and describe the function of each stage in the airflow sequence.
