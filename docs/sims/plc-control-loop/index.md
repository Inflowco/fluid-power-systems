## About this MicroSim

This interactive diagram illustrates how a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) reads sensor inputs, executes control logic, and drives output devices in a closed-loop control system, using a cooling water pump as a concrete example.

## Learning Objective

Students will be able to explain how a PLC reads sensor inputs, executes control logic, and drives output devices in a closed-loop control system.
