[Run the Filter Pressure Monitor MicroSim](main.html){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

## About this MicroSim

This simulation demonstrates how differential pressure across a filter increases as contaminants accumulate. Students can adjust contamination rate and filter MERV rating to see how these factors affect filter loading and maintenance timing.

## Learning Objective

Students will be able to demonstrate how differential pressure changes as a filter loads with contaminants and calculate when a filter needs replacement based on pressure readings.
