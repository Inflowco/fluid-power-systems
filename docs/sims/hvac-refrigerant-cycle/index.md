## About this MicroSim

This simulation shows the four stages of the refrigerant cycle (evaporation, compression, condensation, expansion) with animated particles that change color and size to represent state changes. Adjust outdoor temperature and indoor setpoint to see how they affect system performance.

## Learning Objective

Students will be able to explain the four stages of the refrigerant cycle and describe the state changes that occur at each component.
