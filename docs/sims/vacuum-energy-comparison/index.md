## About this MicroSim

This interactive comparison shows energy consumption across four vacuum pump types and three operating strategies (constant speed, on/off control, VFD control). Students can adjust system demand, electricity rate, and operating hours to explore how pump selection and control strategy affect annual energy cost and environmental impact.

## Learning Objective

Students will be able to assess the energy consumption of different vacuum pump types and operating strategies, and justify recommendations for energy-efficient vacuum system design.
