[Run the Data Decision Pipeline MicroSim](main.html){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

## About this MicroSim

This step-through simulation shows how a single sensor reading travels from a physical vibration sensor through data processing stages to generate a maintenance decision. Students can step through each stage to see concrete data values at each transformation.

## Learning Objective

Students will be able to explain how raw sensor data is processed through a pipeline to generate maintenance decisions, tracing concrete data values through each stage.
