## About this MicroSim

This interactive comparison shows energy and water consumption across different cooling strategies — once-through, open recirculating standard, open recirculating with VFDs, and dry/hybrid cooling — alongside optimization impacts from VFDs, free cooling, and AI-driven controls. Students adjust parameters to see how cooling load, electricity rate, water rate, and climate affect total operating cost.

## Learning Objective

Students will be able to assess the energy and water consumption of different cooling strategies and justify recommendations for efficient and sustainable cooling water system design.
