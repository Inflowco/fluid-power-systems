## About this MicroSim

This simulated cooling water monitoring dashboard displays real-time sensor data for a cooling tower system. Students can switch between normal operation and four fault scenarios — rising conductivity, scale formation, corrosion event, and biological upset — to practice diagnosing water chemistry problems from parameter trends.

## Learning Objective

Students will be able to interpret cooling water quality data from a monitoring dashboard and diagnose common water chemistry problems based on parameter trends and sensor patterns.
