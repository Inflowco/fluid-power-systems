## About this MicroSim

This interactive comparison shows energy consumption under three HVAC control strategies: manual, programmable thermostat, and AI-optimized. Adjust building size, electricity rate, and climate zone to see how AI-driven controls deliver quantified energy and cost savings.

## Learning Objective

Students will be able to assess the energy impact of different HVAC optimization strategies and justify the use of AI-driven controls based on quantified savings data.
