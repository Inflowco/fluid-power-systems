## About this MicroSim

This animated diagram shows cross-section views of four common air compressor types — reciprocating, rotary screw, rotary vane, and centrifugal — with moving parts to illustrate their operating principles. Summary cards below each compressor display key specifications including pressure range, flow rate, oil-free capability, duty cycle, and best applications.

### How to Use

- **Click any compressor** to pause or resume its animation
- **Hover over labels** to see detailed explanations of each component
- **Click "Show Air Flow"** to toggle colored arrows showing the air path through each compressor (blue for inlet air, orange for compressed air)
- The grid adjusts from 2x2 on wide screens to a single column on narrow screens

## Learning Objective

Students will be able to compare the operating principles of four common air compressor types and classify each by its key characteristics.

## Lesson Plan

### Target Audience

Undergraduate students and technicians studying fluid power systems, compressed air systems, or industrial maintenance.

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of pressure and gas behavior
- Familiarity with mechanical concepts (pistons, rotors, valves)

### Activities

1. **Explore Each Compressor** (5 min): Students observe all four compressor animations and identify the primary moving parts in each type.
2. **Compare Operating Principles** (5 min): Using the "Show Air Flow" toggle, students trace how air enters, is compressed, and exits in each compressor type.
3. **Classify by Application** (5 min): Students review the specification cards and answer: "Which compressor type would you choose for a hospital air supply? For a large manufacturing plant? Justify your answer."
4. **Discussion**: Compare the advantages and disadvantages of positive displacement compressors (reciprocating, rotary screw, rotary vane) versus dynamic compressors (centrifugal).

### Assessment

- Students should be able to name the four compressor types and describe the mechanical motion of each.
- Students should be able to match each compressor type to appropriate applications based on its pressure range, flow rate, and duty cycle.
- Students should be able to explain why centrifugal compressors are preferred for very high flow applications.
