## About this MicroSim

This interactive simulation lets students adjust water chemistry parameters — pH, calcium hardness, alkalinity, TDS, temperature, and chemical inhibitor dosages — and observe the resulting corrosion rate and scale formation on an animated heat exchanger tube cross-section. The Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) is calculated in real time.

## Learning Objective

Students will be able to demonstrate how water chemistry parameters affect corrosion and scale formation rates, and implement treatment adjustments to bring both under control.
